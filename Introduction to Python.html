                        <ul>
                            <li>Python was developed in the late eighties, i.e., late 1980's by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> at the <strong>National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands</strong> (managed by the DUTCH Government) as a successor of ABC language capable of exception handling and interfacing.</li>
                            <li>Python is derived from programming languages such as ABC, Modula 3, small talk, Algol-68.</li>
                            <li>Van Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from a TV show, <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus.</strong></li>
                            <li>Python page is a file with a .py extension that contains could be the combination of HTML Tags and Python scripts.</li>
                            <li>Pythons first working version was ready by early 1990 and Van Rossum released it for the public on February 20, 1991. Then on 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and includes new features.</li>

                        <p>Python is considered as one of the most versatile programming languages.</p>
                        <p>Python is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language with high-level programming capabilities.</p>
                        <p>It has become famous because of its apparent and easily understandable syntax, portability and easy to learn.</p>
                        <p>Python is a programming language that includes features of C and Java. It provides the style of writing an elegant code like C, and for object-oriented programming, it offers classes and objects like Java.</p>

                            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>

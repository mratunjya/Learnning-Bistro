            <ul>
              <li>Python was developed in the late eighties, i.e., late 1980's by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> at the <strong>National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands</strong> (managed by the DUTCH Government) as a successor of ABC language capable of exception handling and interfacing.</li>
              <li>Python is derived from programming languages such as ABC, Modula 3, small talk, Algol-68.</li>
              <li>Van Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from a TV show, <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus.</strong></li>
              <li>Python page is a file with a .py extension that contains could be the combination of HTML Tags and Python scripts.</li>
              <li>Pythons first working version was ready by early 1990 and Van Rossum released it for the public on February 20, 1991. Then on 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and includes new features.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).</li>
              <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
              <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
              <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
              <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>

              <h2>Execution of a Python Program</h2>
              <p>After typing the program with .py extension the next step is to Compile the program using Python Compiler. The Compiler Converts the typed program code (source code) into another code called byte code.</p>
              <p>Byte code represents operations like — </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arithmetic Operation,</li>
                <li>Comparison Operation,</li>
                <li>Memory related Operations,</li>
                <p>etc., which run on any operating system and hardware.</p>
              </ul>
              <p>The size of each byte code instruction is 1 byte and hence they are called with the name byte code.</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 5%">
                <p>These byte code instructions are contained in the file .pyc. Hence, the .pyc file represents a Python compiled file.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The next step is to run the program. Any computer can execute only the binary code which comprises 1s and 0s. Since the binary code is understandable to the machine (computer), it is also called machine code. Now we need to convert our byte code into binary code (machine code) so our computer can understand and execute it. For this purpose, we should use PVM (Python Virtual Machine).</p>
              <p>PVM first understands the byte code and converts it into machine code. PVM first understands the processor and operating system in our computer. Then PVM uses an interpreter which understands byte code and convert it into machine code understandable to that processor and into that format understandable to that operating system</p>

                <p>An interpreter translates the program source code line by line. Hence, it is slow. The interpreter that is found inside the PVM runs the Python program slowly.</p>
                <p>A compiler is added to the PVM. This Compiler also converts the byte code into machine code but faster than the interpreter.</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                  <p>This Compiler is called JIT (Just In Time) compiler. The advantage of JIT is to improve the speed of the execution of a Python program and thus improving the performance.</p>

              <h2>Memory Management in Python</h2>
              <p>In Python, Memory allocation and de-allocation are done during runtime automatically. The programmer need not allocate memory while creating objects or deallocate memory when deleting the objects. Python’s PVM take care of such issues.</p>
              <p>Everything is considered as an object in Python. For example, Strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even Modules are also objects. For every object, memory manager (inside the PVM) allocates the memory required for objects created in a Python program. All these objects are stored on a separate memory called heap. Heap is a memory which is allocated during runtime. The size of the heap memory depends on the Random Access Memory (RAM) of our computer and it can increase and decrease its size depending on the requirement of the program.</p>

            <div id="Garbage-Collection-in-Python">
              <h2>Garbage Collection in Python</h2>
              <p>A module represents Python code that performs a specific task. Garbage collector is a module in Python that is useful to delete object from memory which are not used in the program. The module that represents the garbage collector is named as gc. Garbage collector is the simplest way to maintain a count of each object regarding how many times that object is referenced (or used). When an object is referenced twice, its reference count will be 2. When an object has some count, it is being used in the program and hence garbage collector will not remove it from memory. When an object is found with a reference count 0, garbage collector will understand that the object is not used by the program and hence it can be deleted from memory. Hence, the memory allocated for the object is the de-allocated for freed.</p>
              <p>Garbage collector can detect reference cycles. A reference cycle is a cycle of references pointing to the first object from last object.</p>
              <img src="Images/Garbage-Collection-in-Python.png" alt="Garbage Collection in Python" title="Garbage Collection in Python" style="width:100%; max-width: 1488px;">
              <p>Garbage collector runs automatically. Python schedules garbage collector depending upon a number called <em>threshold</em>. This number represents the frequency of how many times the garbage collector removed (or collected) the objects. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocation is greater than the <em>threshold</em> number, the garbage collector will run automatically. One can know the whole number by using the method <code>get_threshold()</code> of <em>gc</em> module.</p>
              <p>When more and more objects are created and if the system runs out of memory, then the automatic garbage collector will not run. Instead the Python program with throw exceptions (runtime error). When the programmer is sure that his program does not contain any reference cycles, then automatic garbage collector is best suitable.</p>
              <p>In some cases, where reference cycles are found in the program, it is better to run the garbage collector manually. For this purpose, <code>collect()</code> method of <em>gc</em> module can be used. Manual garbage collection can be done in two ways: time-based and event-based. If garbage collector is called in certain intervals of time, it is called time-based garbage collection. If the garbage collector is called on the basis of an event, for example, when the user disconnected from an application, is called event based garbage collection. However, running the garbage collector too frequently will slow down the program execution.</p>
